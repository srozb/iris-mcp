# TODO

- [ ] Expand unit tests to cover list_events/list_evidence/list_iocs parsing of Iris API payloads (timeline/evidences/ioc collections).
- [x] Add tests for note directory resolution plus add_note/search/get/update/delete and comment helpers.
- [ ] Re-check tool docstrings and parameter naming against docs/case.md so MCP usage hints stay accurate.
- [ ] Consider exposing additional case helpers (tasks, datastore uploads, alert handling) if analysts need them.
- [ ] Run a live sanity check against the test instance (e.g., case 16) after code changes to confirm listing/update flows.
- [ ] Add task tool coverage to docs/tests for completeness.
